CPU SCHEDULING SIMULATOR

A web-based simulator for visualizing and comparing CPU scheduling algorithms, built for Operating Systems coursework and demonstrations. The simulator allows users to manually input or randomly generate process data and observe how different scheduling strategies affect execution flow, waiting times, and turnaround times.
Featuring real-time Gantt chart generation, step-by-step simulation, and performance metrics, this tool provides a hands-on way to understand and compare scheduling behaviors such as FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ).
Designed for educational clarity and interactivity, this simulator runs entirely in the browser â€” no installations or servers required. Ideal for students, instructors, and anyone learning how operating systems manage CPU scheduling.
